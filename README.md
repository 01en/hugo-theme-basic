## Getting started

### Installation

Run this command from the root of your Hugo directory (Git needs to be installed):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/siegerts/hugo-theme-basic.git
```

Or, if your Hugo site is already in git, you can include this repository as a git submodule. This makes it easier to update this theme. For this you need to run:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/siegerts/hugo-theme-basic.git themes/hugo-theme-basic
```

Alternatively, if you are not familiar with git, you can download the theme as a .zip file, unzip the theme contents, and then move the unzipped source into your themes directory.

For more information, read the official [documentation](https://gohugo.io/themes/installing-and-using-themes) of Hugo.

### Configuration

Take a look at the sample `config.toml`file located in the `exampleSite` folder. You can just copy the `config.toml` to the root directory of your Hugo site. There are instructions in the example configuration file, feel free to change strings as you like to customize your website.
